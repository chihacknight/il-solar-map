As of May 8, 2025, an additional 327 megawatts (MW) of solar have been energized in the State of Illinois, bringing the total to 4,648 MW. 83,542 solar projects have been energized in our state.

Additionally, 1,515 MW of planned solar projects have been added since our update last month. The majority of this increase (1,420 MW) is in the planned Large Distributed Generation (Large DG) category. Projects appear to be [spread throughout the entire state](/index.html#/?status=planned&category=dg_large_kw).

Data from our 3 primary sources are updated at different intervals, so the above data is valid as of the following the dates:

* Illinois Adjustable Block Program (ABP) **May 2025**
* Illinois Solar for All (ILSFA) **May 2025**
* US EIA-860M (Utility scale projects) **March 2024**

### New map bucket sizes

Since we launched this project two years ago, over 3 gigawatts of solar have come online in the State of Illinois. To continue to make the maps easy to read, we have updated the numbers we are shading the map by to account for the larger numbers.

Note the differences between these two maps. They are showing the same data, but the map on the right is shaded with higher numbers. Without doing this, eventually the gradual increase in solar projects would make these maps all one color!
