Illinois Solar Map is now planned solar projects, in addition to energized projects. 

With the rapid deployment of solar in Illinois, the queue for new projects to get built and connected to the grid has grown, and [grid operators are struggling to keep up](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/04/21/clean-energy-waitlist-illinois/). 

To help bring transparency and understanding to this issue, we have added planned projects to Illinois Solar Map. To view planned projects, select the 'Planned' button to the left of the map. As with active energized projects, you can also see planned projects by Census Tract, County and legislative district. Hovering over a place will show you a table of both energized and planned projects for that area.

We are also showing the aggregate solar projects both energized and planned in the future by month on the [About page](/about.html):
