Illinois Solar Map is now showing the top 10 energized and top 10 planned solar projects in Illinois by megawatt on the [Reference Tables page](/reference-tables.html#largest). 

All of these projects are Utility scale solar and represent the largest individual increases in solar capacity in the state. As projects that require significant time and resources to bring online, keeping tabs on these projects is useful in tracking the rapid deployment of solar in our state.
