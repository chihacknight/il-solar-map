As of June 10, 2025, an additional 52 megawatts (MW) of solar have been energized in the State of Illinois, bringing the total to 4,700 MW.

In a [reversal from last month](/update/data-update-2025-may), the planned Large Distributed Generation (Large DG) category was reduced by 1,415 MW. Unclear if this was a data issue or something else. The total planned kW is about where it was in May 2025.
