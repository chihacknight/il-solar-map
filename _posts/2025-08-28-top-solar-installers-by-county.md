In July 2025, the “big beautiful bill” passed by Congress [eliminated the Residential Clean Energy Credits program, among many other clean energy incentives](https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/es/electric-tax-credits). This program provides a 30% tax credit for installing solar panels on your home.

However, these credits are not gone yet. You have until Dec 31, 2025 to install solar panels and receive this credit. Many are already [rushing to get solar panels before this deadline hits](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/07/25/solar-companies-see-rush-demand-after-big-beautiful-bill-ends-tax-credits/), and some solar contractors are already booked out through the end of this year.

To help navigate this chaotic time, we are publishing the top solar contractors in every county in Illinois based on projects completed and total kilowatt hours of capacity installed.

This data comes from data published by the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) on [Illinois Adjustable Block Program Project Applications](https://illinoisabp.com/project-application-reports/), which we use to power the IL Solar Map.

After a bit of data cleanup, below are the top 25 solar installers in Illinois based on projects completed.

_Note: Before selecting a solar installer, you should do your research on them. Illinois Shines has a [useful guide for picking a reliable vendor](/docs/Homeowner-Handbook-Flyer-v250224.pdf)._

Because many of these installers work regionally, we also broke out the solar installers by County. To use the below table, enter your county name into the search box to see the top solar installers in your area:
