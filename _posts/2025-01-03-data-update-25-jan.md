As of Jan 3, 2025, an additional 833 megawatts (MW) of solar have been energized in the State of Illinois. 

This increase is attributed to two very large utility-scale solar projects coming online in November 2024: the 592MW [Double Black Diamond](https://swiftcurrentenergy.com/project/double-black-diamond-solar/) in Sangamon County and 140MW [Wolf Run Solar](https://www.edpr.com/north-america/wolf-run-solar-park) in Morgan County.

As of this writing, Double Black Diamond is the largest US solar project east of the Mississippi River! On January 1st, 2025, the City of Chicago switched over to this power source, making [all city buildings powered by renewable energy](https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2024/12/24/chicago-city-owned-buildings-100-percent-renewable-energy-solar-farm).
