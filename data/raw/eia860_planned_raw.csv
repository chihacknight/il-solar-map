"NOTES:
Capacity from facilities with a total generator nameplate capacity less than 1 MW are excluded from this report.  This exclusion may represent a significant portion of capacity for some technologies such as solar photovoltaic generation.
This data is preliminary and not fully verified.  There may be discrepancies between the status and the commercial operation date.
Links to Google Map and Bing Map were set up to connect to these sites at the time of publication of this inventory. The links may not properly function if these sites update their protocol for accessing maps.
